# Quick Fix Guide: ContactInstitutions Not Loading

## üîç Problem Identified
The ContactInstitutions section is not loading because **Row Level Security (RLS) policies** are blocking access to the `institution_profiles` table.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Fix RLS Policies

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** (in the left sidebar)

### Step 2: Run the Fix Script
Copy and paste this SQL code into the SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Fix RLS policies to allow public access to all institutions
-- Drop existing restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view verified institution profiles" ON institution_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own institution profile" ON institution_profiles;

-- Create a new policy that allows public access to all institutions
CREATE POLICY "Public can view all institution profiles" ON institution_profiles
    FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Test query to verify it works
SELECT 
    id,
    institution_name,
    verified,
    status,
    user_id,
    created_at
FROM institution_profiles;
```

### Step 3: Click "Run"
Execute the SQL script by clicking the "Run" button.

### Step 4: Verify Success
You should see your institution data returned in the results.

### Step 5: Test the App
1. Go back to your app
2. Navigate to the **Contact Institution** section
3. Your "Global Learning Academy" should now appear!

## üéØ Expected Result
After running the fix:
- ‚úÖ **Institution data loads** without errors
- ‚úÖ **"Global Learning Academy" appears** in the Contact Institution section
- ‚úÖ **All contact information** is displayed
- ‚úÖ **Email contact functionality** works
- ‚úÖ **Verification status** is clearly shown

## üîß Alternative: Temporary RLS Disable
If the above doesn't work, you can temporarily disable RLS:

```sql
-- Temporarily disable RLS
ALTER TABLE institution_profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Test query
SELECT * FROM institution_profiles;

-- IMPORTANT: Re-enable after testing
-- ALTER TABLE institution_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## üìã What the Debug Logs Will Show
After the fix, you should see:
- `‚úÖ [ContactInstitutions] Found institutions: 1`
- `üîç [ContactInstitutions] Transformed institutions: [institution data]`
- No more "RLS policies blocking access" messages

## üö® Important Notes
- The RLS fix allows public access to institution data
- This is appropriate for a public directory of institutions
- The fix maintains security for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- Only SELECT operations are made public

## üÜò If Still Not Working
1. Check the browser console for any new error messages
2. Verify the SQL script ran successfully in Supabase
3. Make sure you're logged in as a user (not anonymous)
4. Try refreshing the page after running the fix
