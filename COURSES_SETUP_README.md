## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the content from `supabase/migrations/create_courses_table.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the migration

### Step 2: Verify Table Creation
1. Go to Table Editor in Supabase
2. You should see the new `courses` table
3. Verify that RLS policies are enabled
4. Check that indexes are created for performance

### Step 3: Test the Functionality
1. Log in as a tutor
2. Navigate to the "Courses" tab
3. Try creating a new course
4. Test editing and deleting courses
5. Verify that courses appear in the dashboard overview

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Tutors can only view, create, edit, and delete their own courses
- Students can view active courses for browsing
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates

### Data Validation
- Required fields: title, subject
- Level validation: beginner, intermediate, advanced, all_levels
- Numeric constraints for duration, price, and max students

## API Endpoints

The courses functionality uses these Supabase operations:
- `SELECT` - Load tutor's courses
- `INSERT` - Create new course
- `UPDATE` - Edit existing course
- `DELETE` - Remove course
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

## Component Structure

```
CourseManagement.tsx
├── Course creation dialog
