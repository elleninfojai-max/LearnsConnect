# Fix Authentication Issue

## 🔍 Problem Identified
The ContactInstitutions section is failing because of an **authentication issue**:

```
Current user: {user: undefined, userError: AuthSessionMissingError: Auth session missing!
```

Even though the RLS policies are correctly configured, the Supabase client is not properly authenticated.

## ✅ Solutions

### Option 1: Re-login (Quick Fix)
1. **Log out** of your application
2. **Log back in** with your credentials
3. **Navigate to Contact Institution section**
4. The institution should now appear

### Option 2: Clear Browser Data
1. **Clear browser cookies and local storage**
2. **Refresh the page**
3. **Log in again**
4. **Test the Contact Institution section**

### Option 3: Check Authentication State
The enhanced debugging will now show:
- Current user authentication status
- Session information
- Automatic session refresh attempts

## 🔧 What the Enhanced Code Does

1. **Authentication Check**: Verifies if user is properly authenticated
2. **Session Recovery**: Attempts to refresh expired sessions
3. **Better Error Messages**: Shows specific authentication vs RLS errors
4. **Fallback Handling**: Provides clear guidance on what to do

## 📊 Expected Debug Output

After the fix, you should see:
```
🔍 [ContactInstitutions] Current user: {user: "user-id", userError: null}
✅ [ContactInstitutions] Found institutions: 1
```

Instead of:
```
🔍 [ContactInstitutions] Current user: {user: undefined, userError: AuthSessionMissingError}
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Try logging out and back in**
2. **Check the browser console** for the new authentication debugging
3. **The institution should appear** once authentication is working

The RLS policies are correctly configured - the issue is just authentication! 🚀
